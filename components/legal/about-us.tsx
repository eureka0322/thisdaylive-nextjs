                    <h2 style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>The beginning…</h2>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>THISDAY is published by THISDAY Newspapers Limited. It hit newsstands on January 22, 1995 and quickly carved out a niche for itself in business and political reporting and for breaking big news stories. It soon became Nigeria’s newspaper of record.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>In its first years of publication, THISDAY won the Newspaper of the Year Award for three consecutive years. In 1997 THISDAY also became the first Nigerian newspaper to introduce full colour printing. It now has printing plants in Lagos, Abuja and in the Niger Delta.</p>
                    <h2 style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Where we are…</h2>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Today THISDAY remains the preferred newspaper among the business, political and diplomatic elite, and is easily the most recognisable and influential national media brand globally. It is also the corporate and political advertiser’s first choice. THISDAY is the only high profile newspaper that appeals to both young and old because of its straightforward news reporting, strong editorial content, lifestyle features and business coverage.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>THISDAY breaks the news first: from the story of the first arrests over the 1995 coup which lead to the imprisonment of Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Shehu Musa Yar’Adua; the death of Nigeria’s first president, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, which all other media missed; to the newspaper’s exclusive on the recovery of the Abacha billions and several more, day after day. In line with its avowed commitment to democracy, THISDAY was at the forefront of the battle against dictatorial military rule for which its reporters were invariably detained and harassed. The Chairman and Editor-in-Chief was detained in 1997 at the Department of Military Intelligence (DMI) for seven days under Abacha. The Chairman later went into self-exile.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>For many Nigerians, if the news is not in THISDAY, then it is not credible.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>THISDAY is an agent of change and innovation within the industry and many of its ‘firsts’ are serially copied by others, such as the back page sports with advertising and back page opinions, an all-gloss Sunday magazine and wraparounds.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Most recently, THISDAY launched ARISE, the global style and culture magazine. The debut issue was given away at THISDAY’s Africa Rising concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall in October 2008 and was so well received that the second issue officially launched on newsstands in February 2009. It is now sold in several countries around the world.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>The company’s major events centre, the THISDAY DOME in Abuja’s Central Business District, is where the annual THISDAY Awards for Excellence are held and also plays host to several events for the Nigerian society and intelligencia.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>The THISDAY Annual Awards for Excellence has attracted several world leaders and statesmen including former US Presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, former Mexican President, Vicente Fox and former UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. It has also hosted the former United Kingdom Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown along with former Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. Former US Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice, Henry Kissinger and General Colin Powell have also participated along with other international dignitaries including the former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, the former Prime Minister of France, Dominique de Villepin, former Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern and Harvard Professor Larry Summers, a former Economic Adviser to President Obama, former World Bank President James Wolfhensoln and Steve Forbes, the publisher of Forbes magazine. Other keynote speakers have included prominent Washington insiders and analysts, like Andrew Card, William Kristol, Karl Rove, Paul Begala, Howard Dean, Donna Brazille, and Paula Zahn.</p>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Through its publications, business events, cultural showcases and festivals, THISDAY is a player on the global stage by bringing the world to Nigeria and taking Nigeria to the world.</p>
                    <h2 style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Where we are headed…</h2>
                    <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>THISDAY believes in its editorial values and is fast becoming a global media player pursuing, with vigour its vision of the world seen from an African perspective.</p>
